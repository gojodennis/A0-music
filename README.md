- Artwork-rich album and playlist views
- Fast search with recent history and expandable song results
- Favorites, play counts and recent playback awareness
- Folder-aware library scanning with auto refresh handling

- USB DAC and direct-output awareness for cleaner output paths where supported by the device

Supported audio format handling is based on Android Media3/ExoPlayer, Android platform decoders and A;0's own container validation. Bit depth applies to lossless or PCM sources; lossy codecs do not expose a meaningful playback bit depth. Bitrate support is stream and device dependent unless the codec defines a fixed mode range.

| Format | Extensions | Supported codec/container handling | Bit depth support | Bitrate support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MP3 | `.mp3` | MPEG audio playback through platform decoder support | Not applicable for lossy MP3 | CBR/VBR MP3 streams, commonly up to 320 kbps |
| AAC / ADTS | `.aac` | Raw AAC/ADTS audio where supported by the device | Not applicable for lossy AAC | Codec/profile dependent AAC bitrates |
| MP4 audio | `.m4a`, `.mp4`, `.m4b` | Audio-only MP4-family containers, including AAC and supported ALAC where the device decoder is available | AAC: not applicable; ALAC: source lossless bit depth where supported by the device | AAC lossy bitrate or ALAC lossless stream bitrate, metadata/device dependent |
| FLAC | `.flac` | Native FLAC playback | Lossless source bit depth, typically 16-bit or 24-bit when accepted by the platform decoder | Lossless stream bitrate, metadata dependent |
| WAV | `.wav` | WAV/PCM-style audio accepted by the platform decoder | PCM source bit depth where supported by the device | Uncompressed PCM rate based on sample rate, bit depth and channels |
| Ogg Vorbis | `.ogg`, `.oga` | Ogg container with Vorbis audio | Not applicable for lossy Vorbis | Vorbis CBR/VBR stream bitrate |
| Ogg Opus | `.ogg`, `.oga` | Ogg container with Opus audio | Not applicable for lossy Opus | Opus stream bitrate, codec/device dependent |
| Ogg FLAC | `.ogg`, `.oga` | Ogg container with FLAC audio where validated and supported | Lossless source bit depth where supported by the device | Lossless stream bitrate, metadata dependent |
| Opus | `.opus` | Standalone Opus audio where supported by the platform decoder | Not applicable for lossy Opus | Opus stream bitrate, codec/device dependent |
| AMR | `.amr` | AMR audio for supported voice recordings | Not applicable for AMR speech codec | AMR-NB/WB fixed mode bitrates, device dependent |
| 3GP audio | `.3gp` | Audio-only 3GP containers; video-containing files are excluded | Codec dependent; usually not applicable for AMR/AAC | Contained audio codec bitrate, metadata/device dependent |
| Matroska audio | `.mka` | Audio-only Matroska containers; video-containing files are excluded | Codec dependent, for example FLAC source bit depth when supported | Contained audio codec bitrate, metadata/device dependent |

### Audio controls
